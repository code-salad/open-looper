# Create GitHub PR Skill

Analyzes the current branch changes, generates a comprehensive PR description with Mermaid architecture diagrams, commits, pushes, and opens a pull request.

## Prerequisites

- Must be in a git repository
- Must have uncommitted or unpushed changes on a non-main branch
- `gh` CLI must be authenticated (`gh auth status`)

---

## Phase 0: Preflight Checks

Run these checks in parallel:

```bash
# Check 1: Confirm inside a git repo
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree

# Check 2: Confirm gh CLI is authenticated
gh auth status

# Check 3: Get current branch name
git branch --show-current

# Check 4: Get the default/base branch
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
```

**Gate:** Abort with a clear message if:
- Not in a git repo
- `gh` is not authenticated

**Branch resolution:**
- If `CURRENT_BRANCH` != GitHub default branch → set `BASE_BRANCH` = GitHub default branch (normal case)
- If `CURRENT_BRANCH` == GitHub default branch → do NOT abort. Instead:
  1. Look for a plausible base branch by checking if alternative branches exist (locally or on remote):
     ```bash
     # If GitHub default IS main/master, check for develop or release
     # If GitHub default is something else (e.g., alpha), check for main or master first
     for candidate in main master develop release; do
       if [ "$candidate" != "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]; then
         if git rev-parse --verify "$candidate" >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
            git rev-parse --verify "origin/$candidate" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
           BASE_BRANCH="$candidate"
           break
         fi
       fi
     done
     ```
  2. If a plausible base is found, set `BASE_BRANCH` to that and inform the user:
     "Current branch is the GitHub default. Using `<base>` as PR target."
  3. If no plausible base is found, prompt the user to specify a `--base <branch>` target.
     Do not proceed until the user provides one.

Store:
- `CURRENT_BRANCH` = current branch name
- `BASE_BRANCH` = resolved base branch (may differ from the GitHub default branch)

---

## Phase 1: Gather Context

### 1a. Collect change information (run in parallel)

First, resolve the base ref to use in diff/log commands. The local branch ref may not exist
(e.g., when `BASE_BRANCH` is `main` but no local `main` branch has been checked out):

```bash
# Resolve the base ref: prefer local branch, fall back to remote tracking branch
if git rev-parse --verify "$BASE_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  BASE_REF="$BASE_BRANCH"
elif git rev-parse --verify "origin/$BASE_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  BASE_REF="origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
else
  # Fetch the base branch from remote and use the remote tracking ref
  git fetch origin "$BASE_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null
  BASE_REF="origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
fi
```

Then run these commands in parallel using `$BASE_REF` for all diff/log operations:

```bash
# All changes: staged + unstaged + untracked
git status

# Diff of all changes against the base branch
git diff $BASE_REF...HEAD

# Unstaged/staged working tree changes
git diff
git diff --cached

# Commit log since divergence from base
git log --oneline $BASE_REF..HEAD

# Files changed summary
git diff --stat $BASE_REF...HEAD
```

### 1b. Understand the codebase architecture

Use the Glob and Read tools to understand the project:

1. **Identify the project type** — look for package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, *.csproj, etc.
2. **Read key config files** — understand the tech stack, frameworks, dependencies.
3. **Read the files that were changed** — use `git diff --name-only $BASE_REF...HEAD` to get the list, then Read each file (or the most important ones if there are many).
4. **Read surrounding context** — for each changed file, read related files (imports, callers, tests) to understand the before/after architecture.

### 1c. Discover and run tests/checks

Detect available test and lint commands by checking for:

| Signal | Command to run |
|--------|---------------|
| `package.json` with `scripts.test` | `npm test` or `bun test` |
| `package.json` with `scripts.lint` | `npm run lint` |
| `package.json` with `scripts.typecheck` or `scripts.check` | `npm run typecheck` or `npm run check` |
| `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml [tool.pytest]`, or `tests/` dir with `.py` | `uv run pytest` or `pytest` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` |
| `go.mod` | `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` |
| `Makefile` with `test` target | `make test` |
| `*.csproj` | `dotnet test` |
| `.github/workflows/` | Note CI workflows but don't run them |

Run the detected commands. Capture output including:
- Total tests run / passed / failed / skipped
- Lint warnings or errors
- Type-check results
- Build success/failure

If tests fail, **do not abort** — record the failures for the PR description.

---

## Phase 2: Analyze and Synthesize

Using everything gathered in Phase 1, produce the following analysis. Think carefully about each section — the PR description is the primary deliverable of this skill.

### 2a. Problem / Task Statement

Write 2-4 sentences describing:
- **What** problem or task this PR addresses
- **Current behavior** — what happens now (the bug, limitation, or missing capability)
- **Expected behavior** — what should happen after this PR is merged
- **Why** it matters (user impact, tech debt, bug severity, etc.)
- Infer this from: branch name, commit messages, changed file names, diff content, and the `$ARGUMENTS` if provided.

### 2b. Existing Architecture (Before)

Describe the architecture of the code **before** these changes, focusing on the components that are being modified. Include a Mermaid diagram.

Guidelines for the Mermaid diagram:
- Use `graph TD` or `flowchart TD` for component/flow diagrams
- Use `sequenceDiagram` for interaction flows
- Use `classDiagram` for object/type relationships
- Keep it focused on the **relevant** parts — not the entire system
- Label nodes clearly with file/module names where applicable
- Highlight the area that is about to change

Example structure:
```
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Module A] --> B[Module B]
    B --> C[Database]
    style B fill:#f66,stroke:#333
```
```

### 2c. Proposed Architecture (After)

Describe the architecture **after** these changes. Include a Mermaid diagram showing:
- New components introduced
- Modified relationships
- Removed dependencies
- Use green/blue highlights for new/changed nodes

Example structure:
```
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Module A] --> B[Module B - refactored]
    A --> D[New Module D]
    D --> C[Database]
    B --> D
    style B fill:#6f6,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#69f,stroke:#333
```
```

### 2d. Key Changes Walkthrough

List the most important changes grouped logically (not file-by-file). For each group:
- What changed and why
- Any trade-offs or decisions made

### 2e. Tests & Checks Summary

Summarize results from Phase 1c:
- Which test suites ran and their results
- Lint/type-check status
- Any known issues or skipped tests
- If no tests exist, note that explicitly

---

## Phase 3: Commit & Push

### 3a-pre. Scaffold integration CI (if missing)

Before staging, check if the target repo has an integration test workflow. If
integration tests exist in `tests/integration/` but no CI workflow runs them,
scaffold one:

```bash
# Only scaffold if integration tests exist but no workflow does
if [ -d "tests/integration" ] && [ ! -f ".github/workflows/integration.yml" ]; then
    REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
    SCRIPTS_DIR="${REPO_ROOT}/.opencode/skills/looper/scripts"
    if [ -x "$SCRIPTS_DIR/scaffold-integration-ci" ]; then
        "$SCRIPTS_DIR/scaffold-integration-ci"
    fi
fi
```

If scaffolded, the new workflow file will be included in the PR commit below.

### 3a. Stage and commit

Check `git status` for unstaged or untracked changes that should be included.

```bash
# Stage all relevant changes (be specific — avoid staging secrets or env files)
git add <files>

# Commit with a concise message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>: <short summary>

<optional body: 1-2 sentences of context>
EOF
)"
```

Commit message `<type>` should be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`, `build`.

**Important:**
- Do NOT stage files matching: `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials*`, `secrets*`, `*.secret`
- If there are already commits on the branch and no new working-tree changes, skip this step.

### 3b. Push

```bash
git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH
```

If the push is rejected (e.g., diverged history), inform the user and ask how to proceed. Do NOT force push.

---

## Phase 4: Create the Pull Request

Assemble the PR description from Phase 2 and create the PR.

**PR title MUST use conventional commit format:** `<type>: <concise description>`

The `<type>` prefix must be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`, `build`. Optionally include a scope: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` (e.g., `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow`). Infer the type from the nature of the changes — use the same logic as the commit message type in Phase 3a.

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base "$BASE_BRANCH" \
  --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" \
  --title "<type>: <concise description, max 70 chars total>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem / Task

<2-4 sentences from Phase 2a>

**Current behavior:** <what happens now>
**Expected behavior:** <what should happen after this PR>

EOF
)"
```

## Phase 5: Wait for CI to Pass

After the PR is created, you MUST wait for CI checks to complete before reporting back to the user. Do not return early.

### 5a. Detect CI checks

```bash
# Get the PR number from the create output (or query it)
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')

# Check if any CI checks are configured
gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
```

If no checks are configured (command returns nothing or "no checks"), skip to Phase 5c.

### 5b. Poll CI status until completion

Use `gh pr checks` with `--watch` to block until all checks finish:

```bash
gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER --watch
```

This command blocks until all checks complete (pass or fail). Let it run — do NOT set a short timeout. Use a timeout of at least 600000ms (10 minutes).

If `--watch` is unavailable or errors, fall back to manual polling:

```bash
# Poll every 30 seconds, up to 40 attempts (20 minutes max)
for i in $(seq 1 40); do
  STATUS=$(gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER 2>&1)
  echo "$STATUS"

  # Check if all checks have completed (no "pending" or "in_progress" or "queued")
  if echo "$STATUS" | grep -qiE "pending|in_progress|queued"; then
    sleep 30
  else
    break
  fi
done
```

### 5c. Report final status

After CI completes, gather the final results:

```bash
gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
```

Parse the output and report to the user with this format:

**If ALL checks passed:**
```
✅ PR #<number> created and all CI checks passed.
<PR URL>

CI Results:
  ✅ <check-name-1> (Xm Ys)
  ✅ <check-name-2> (Xm Ys)
```

**If ANY check failed:**
```
❌ PR #<number> created but CI checks failed.
<PR URL>

CI Results:
  ✅ <check-name-1> (Xm Ys)
  ❌ <check-name-2> (Xm Ys) — FAILED
  ✅ <check-name-3> (Xm Ys)

Failed check details:
  View logs: gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER --failed
```

When a check fails, also run `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` if possible to surface the failure reason directly to the user.

**If CI timed out (exceeded polling limit):**
```
⏳ PR #<number> created but CI is still running after 20 minutes.
<PR URL>

Check status manually: gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
```

**IMPORTANT:** Only report back to the user AFTER CI has completed (or timed out). The user expects to see the final CI result, not just the PR URL.

---

## Phase 6: Merge or leave as PR (if CI passed)

After CI passes, decide whether to merge or leave the PR open for manual review.

### 6a-pre. Detect DB migrations in changeset

Before merging, check whether the PR contains DB migration files. If DB migrations
are present, the PR must NOT be auto-merged — it is left open for manual review.

```bash
# Detect if PR contains DB migration files
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only "$BASE_REF"...HEAD)
HAS_MIGRATIONS=false

# Check for common migration directory patterns
if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -qiE \
    '(migrations?/|db/migrate|alembic/versions|flyway|prisma/migrations|drizzle/|knex/migrations|sequelize/migrations|typeorm/migrations|migrate.*\.sql$|migration.*\.sql$)'; then
    HAS_MIGRATIONS=true
fi
```

Migration patterns detected:
- `migrations/` or `migration/` — generic migration directories (Django, Flask, Knex, Sequelize, TypeORM, etc.)
- `db/migrate/` — Rails ActiveRecord migrations
- `alembic/versions/` — Python/Alembic migrations
- `prisma/migrations/` — Prisma ORM migrations
- `drizzle/` — Drizzle ORM migration files
- `knex/migrations/` — Knex.js migrations
- `sequelize/migrations/` — Sequelize migrations
- `typeorm/migrations/` — TypeORM migrations
- `flyway/` — Flyway SQL migrations
- Files matching `migrate*.sql` or `migration*.sql`

### 6a. Squash-merge or skip merge

Only proceed if ALL CI checks passed in Phase 5. If any check failed or timed out, skip this phase entirely.

```bash
if [ "$HAS_MIGRATIONS" = true ]; then
    echo "DB migrations detected — skipping auto-merge. PR left open for manual review."
else
    gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash --delete-branch
fi
```

**Key rule:** When DB migrations are detected, do NOT merge the PR. Leave it open for a human to review and merge manually. Only squash-merge PRs that have no DB involvement.

If the squash merge fails (e.g., merge conflicts, branch protection rules), report the error to the user and do NOT retry. The user may need to resolve conflicts or adjust branch protection settings.

### 6b. Clean up worktree

If the `$WORKTREE_DIR` variable is set (indicating this PR was created from a looper worktree), remove the worktree after a successful merge or after the PR is left open:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
SCRIPTS_DIR="${REPO_ROOT}/.opencode/skills/looper/scripts"
"$SCRIPTS_DIR/cleanup-worktree" --dir "$WORKTREE_DIR"
```

The `cleanup-worktree` script handles returning to the main repo, removing the worktree, and guarding against `core.bare=true` in a single atomic operation.

If worktree removal fails, warn but do not abort.

### 6c. Report final status

**If squash-merged (no DB migrations):**
```
✅ PR #<number> squash-merged into <BASE_BRANCH> and branch deleted.
<PR URL>
```

**If PR left open (DB migrations detected):**
```
⏸️ PR #<number> created and CI passed, but DB migrations were detected — left open for manual review.
<PR URL>

Merge manually when ready: gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch
```

**If merge failed:**
```
⚠️ PR #<number> CI passed but merge failed: <error reason>
<PR URL>

Merge manually: gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch
```

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|-------|
| No changes to commit and no commits ahead of base | Abort: "Nothing to create a PR for." |
| Tests fail | Warn in PR description, continue creating PR |
| Push rejected | Ask user: rebase, merge, or force push? |
| PR already exists for this branch | Print existing PR URL, ask if user wants to update it |
| `gh` not installed or not authenticated | Abort with install/auth instructions |
| On default branch | Detect alternate base branch (main/master/develop) or prompt user for `--base` target. Do not abort. |
| Sensitive files detected in diff | Warn user, exclude from staging, list them |
| CI checks fail | Report which checks failed, show failed log output, print PR URL |
| CI checks time out (>20 min) | Report timeout, print PR URL, give manual check command |
| No CI checks configured | Note "no CI checks configured", print PR URL, complete normally |
| `gh pr checks --watch` not supported | Fall back to manual polling loop (30s intervals, 40 attempts) |
| Squash merge fails (conflicts) | Report error, print manual merge command `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch`, do NOT retry |
| Squash merge fails (branch protection) | Report error, suggest user review branch protection settings |
| DB migrations detected | Do NOT merge — leave PR open for manual review, report PR URL |
| Worktree cleanup fails | Warn but do not abort — merge already succeeded |

## Diagram Style Guide

When generating Mermaid diagrams, follow these conventions:

- **Color coding:**
  - `fill:#f66` (red) — removed or problematic components
  - `fill:#6f6` (green) — new components
  - `fill:#69f` (blue) — modified components
  - `fill:#ff6` (yellow) — components under discussion
  - No fill — unchanged components
- **Node shapes:**
  - `[Rectangle]` — modules, services, classes
  - `([Stadium])` — entry points, APIs
  - `[(Database)]` — data stores
  - `{Diamond}` — decision points
  - `((Circle))` — events, signals
- **Edges:**
  - `-->` solid arrow — direct dependency / call
  - `-.->` dashed arrow — optional / async
  - `==>` thick arrow — data flow emphasis
- **Subgraphs** — use to group related components (e.g., `subgraph Frontend`, `subgraph Backend`)
- **Keep diagrams readable** — max ~15 nodes per diagram. Split into multiple diagrams if needed.
