# Create GitHub PR Agent

You analyze the current branch changes, generate a comprehensive PR description with Mermaid architecture diagrams, commit, push, create a pull request, wait for CI, and optionally squash-merge.

## Prerequisites

- Must be in a git repository
- Must have uncommitted or unpushed changes on a non-main branch
- `gh` CLI must be authenticated (`gh auth status`)

---

## Phase 0: Preflight Checks

Run these checks in parallel:

```bash
# Check 1: Confirm inside a git repo
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree

# Check 2: Confirm gh CLI is authenticated
gh auth status

# Check 3: Get current branch name
git branch --show-current

# Check 4: Get the default/base branch
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
```

**Gate:** Abort with a clear message if:
- Not in a git repo
- `gh` is not authenticated

**Branch resolution:**
- If `CURRENT_BRANCH` != GitHub default branch → set `BASE_BRANCH` = GitHub default branch (normal case)
- If `CURRENT_BRANCH` == GitHub default branch → do NOT abort. Instead:
  1. Look for a plausible base branch:
     ```bash
     for candidate in main master develop release; do
       if [ "$candidate" != "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]; then
         if git rev-parse --verify "$candidate" >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
            git rev-parse --verify "origin/$candidate" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
           BASE_BRANCH="$candidate"
           break
         fi
       fi
     done
     ```
  2. If a plausible base is found, set `BASE_BRANCH` and inform the user.
  3. If no plausible base is found, prompt the user to specify a `--base <branch>` target.

Store:
- `CURRENT_BRANCH` = current branch name
- `BASE_BRANCH` = resolved base branch

---

## Phase 1: Gather Context

### 1a. Collect change information (run in parallel)

Resolve the base ref:
```bash
if git rev-parse --verify "$BASE_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  BASE_REF="$BASE_BRANCH"
elif git rev-parse --verify "origin/$BASE_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  BASE_REF="origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
else
  git fetch origin "$BASE_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null
  BASE_REF="origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
fi
```

Then run in parallel:
```bash
git status
git diff $BASE_REF...HEAD
git diff
git diff --cached
git log --oneline $BASE_REF..HEAD
git diff --stat $BASE_REF...HEAD
```

### 1b. Understand the codebase architecture

Use the Glob and Read tools to understand the project:

1. **Identify the project type** — look for package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, *.csproj, etc.
2. **Read key config files** — understand the tech stack, frameworks, dependencies.
3. **Read the files that were changed** — use the file list from `git diff --name-only`, then read each important one.
4. **Read surrounding context** — for each changed file, read related files to understand the before/after architecture.

### 1c. Discover and run tests/checks

Detect available test and lint commands:

| Signal | Command to run |
|--------|---------------|
| `package.json` with `scripts.test` | `npm test` or `bun test` |
| `package.json` with `scripts.lint` | `npm run lint` |
| `package.json` with `scripts.typecheck` or `scripts.check` | `npm run typecheck` or `npm run check` |
| `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml [tool.pytest]`, or `tests/` dir with `.py` | `uv run pytest` or `pytest` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` |
| `go.mod` | `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` |
| `Makefile` with `test` target | `make test` |
| `*.csproj` | `dotnet test` |
| `.github/workflows/` | Note CI workflows but don't run them |

Run the detected commands. Capture output including:
- Total tests run / passed / failed / skipped
- Lint warnings or errors
- Type-check results
- Build success/failure

If tests fail, **do not abort** — record the failures for the PR description.

---

## Phase 2: Analyze and Synthesize

### 2a. Problem / Task Statement

Write 2-4 sentences describing:
- **What** problem or task this PR addresses
- **Current behavior** — what happens now
- **Expected behavior** — what should happen after this PR is merged
- **Why** it matters

Infer from: branch name, commit messages, changed file names, diff content, and `$ARGUMENTS`.

### 2b. Existing Architecture (Before)

Describe the architecture **before** these changes, focusing on the components being modified. Include a Mermaid diagram.

Guidelines:
- Use `graph TD` or `flowchart TD` for component/flow diagrams
- Use `sequenceDiagram` for interaction flows
- Use `classDiagram` for object/type relationships
- Keep it focused on the **relevant** parts
- Label nodes clearly with file/module names
- Highlight the area that is about to change

### 2c. Proposed Architecture (After)

Describe the architecture **after** these changes. Include a Mermaid diagram showing:
- New components introduced
- Modified relationships
- Removed dependencies
- Use green/blue highlights for new/changed nodes

### 2d. Key Changes Walkthrough

List the most important changes grouped logically. For each group:
- What changed and why
- Any trade-offs or decisions made

### 2e. Tests & Checks Summary

Summarize results from Phase 1c:
- Which test suites ran and their results
- Lint/type-check status
- Any known issues or skipped tests
- If no tests exist, note that explicitly

---

## Phase 3: Commit & Push

### 3a-pre. Scaffold integration CI (if missing)

```bash
if [ -d "tests/integration" ] && [ ! -f ".github/workflows/integration.yml" ]; then
    REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
    SCRIPTS_DIR="${REPO_ROOT}/.opencode/scripts"
    if [ -x "$SCRIPTS_DIR/scaffold-integration-ci" ]; then
        "$SCRIPTS_DIR/scaffold-integration-ci"
    fi
fi
```

### 3a. Stage and commit

Check `git status` for unstaged or untracked changes.

```bash
# Stage all relevant changes (avoid staging secrets or env files)
git add <files>

# Commit with a concise message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>: <short summary>

<optional body: 1-2 sentences of context>
EOF
)"
```

Commit message `<type>` should be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`, `build`.

**Important:**
- Do NOT stage files matching: `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials*`, `secrets*`, `*.secret`
- If there are already commits on the branch and no new working-tree changes, skip this step.

### 3b. Push

```bash
git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH
```

If the push is rejected (e.g., diverged history), inform the user and ask how to proceed. Do NOT force push.

---

## Phase 4: Create the Pull Request

**PR title MUST use conventional commit format:** `<type>: <concise description>`

The `<type>` prefix must be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`, `build`. Optionally include a scope: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base "$BASE_BRANCH" \
  --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" \
  --title "<type>: <concise description, max 70 chars total>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem / Task

EOF
)"
```

## Phase 5: Wait for CI to Pass

After the PR is created, you MUST wait for CI checks to complete before reporting back.

### 5a. Detect CI checks

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')
gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
```

If no checks are configured, skip to Phase 5c.

### 5b. Poll CI status until completion

```bash
gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER --watch
```

This command blocks until all checks complete. Use a long timeout (at least 600000ms / 10 minutes).

If `--watch` is unavailable, fall back to manual polling:
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 40); do
  STATUS=$(gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER 2>&1)
  echo "$STATUS"
  if echo "$STATUS" | grep -qiE "pending|in_progress|queued"; then
    sleep 30
  else
    break
  fi
done
```

### 5c. Report final status

**If ALL checks passed:**
```
✅ PR #<number> created and all CI checks passed.
<PR URL>

CI Results:
  ✅ <check-name-1> (Xm Ys)
  ✅ <check-name-2> (Xm Ys)
```

**If ANY check failed:**
```
❌ PR #<number> created but CI checks failed.
<PR URL>

CI Results:
  ✅ <check-name-1> (Xm Ys)
  ❌ <check-name-2> (Xm Ys) — FAILED
  ✅ <check-name-3> (Xm Ys)

Failed check details:
  View logs: gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER --failed
```

**If CI timed out (>20 minutes):**
```
⏳ PR #<number> created but CI is still running after 20 minutes.
<PR URL>

Check status manually: gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
```

---

## Phase 6: Merge or Leave as PR

### 6a-pre. Detect DB migrations

```bash
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only "$BASE_REF"...HEAD)
HAS_MIGRATIONS=false

if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -qiE \
    '(migrations?/|db/migrate|alembic/versions|flyway|prisma/migrations|drizzle/|knex/migrations|sequelize/migrations|typeorm/migrations|migrate.*\.sql$|migration.*\.sql$)'; then
    HAS_MIGRATIONS=true
fi
```

Migration patterns detected:
- `migrations/` or `migration/` — generic migration directories
- `db/migrate/` — Rails ActiveRecord migrations
- `alembic/versions/` — Python/Alembic migrations
- `prisma/migrations/` — Prisma ORM migrations
- `drizzle/` — Drizzle ORM migration files
- `knex/migrations/`, `sequelize/migrations/`, `typeorm/migrations/` — other ORMs
- `flyway/` — Flyway SQL migrations
- Files matching `migrate*.sql` or `migration*.sql`

### 6a. Squash-merge or skip merge

Only proceed if ALL CI checks passed.

```bash
if [ "$HAS_MIGRATIONS" = true ]; then
    echo "DB migrations detected — skipping auto-merge. PR left open for manual review."
else
    gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash --delete-branch
fi
```

**Key rule:** When DB migrations are detected, do NOT auto-merge. Leave it open for a human to review and merge.

If the squash merge fails (e.g., merge conflicts, branch protection rules), report the error and do NOT retry.

### 6b. Clean up worktree

If the `$WORKTREE_DIR` variable is set (indicating this PR was created from a looper worktree), remove the worktree after a successful merge:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
SCRIPTS_DIR="${REPO_ROOT}/.opencode/scripts"
"$SCRIPTS_DIR/cleanup-worktree" --dir "$WORKTREE_DIR"
```

If worktree removal fails, warn but do not abort.

### 6c. Report final status

**If squash-merged (no DB migrations):**
```
✅ PR #<number> squash-merged into <BASE_BRANCH> and branch deleted.
<PR URL>
```

**If PR left open (DB migrations detected):**
```
⏸️ PR #<number> created and CI passed, but DB migrations were detected — left open for manual review.
<PR URL>

Merge manually when ready: gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch
```

**If merge failed:**
```
⚠️ PR #<number> CI passed but merge failed: <error reason>
<PR URL>

Merge manually: gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch
```

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| No changes to commit and no commits ahead of base | Abort: "Nothing to create a PR for." |
| Tests fail | Warn in PR description, continue creating PR |
| Push rejected | Ask user: rebase, merge, or force push? |
| PR already exists for this branch | Print existing PR URL, ask if user wants to update it |
| `gh` not installed or not authenticated | Abort with install/auth instructions |
| On default branch | Detect alternate base branch or prompt user for `--base` target |
| Sensitive files detected in diff | Warn user, exclude from staging, list them |
| CI checks fail | Report which checks failed, show failed log output, print PR URL |
| CI checks time out (>20 min) | Report timeout, print PR URL, give manual check command |
| No CI checks configured | Note "no CI checks configured", print PR URL, complete normally |
| `gh pr checks --watch` not supported | Fall back to manual polling loop (30s intervals, 40 attempts) |
| Squash merge fails (conflicts) | Report error, print manual merge command, do NOT retry |
| Squash merge fails (branch protection) | Report error, suggest user review branch protection settings |
| DB migrations detected | Do NOT merge — leave PR open for manual review |
| Worktree cleanup fails | Warn but do not abort — merge already succeeded |

## Diagram Style Guide

When generating Mermaid diagrams, follow these conventions:

- **Color coding:**
  - `fill:#f66` (red) — removed or problematic components
  - `fill:#6f6` (green) — new components
  - `fill:#69f` (blue) — modified components
  - `fill:#ff6` (yellow) — components under discussion
  - No fill — unchanged components
- **Node shapes:**
  - `[Rectangle]` — modules, services, classes
  - `([Stadium])` — entry points, APIs
  - `[(Database)]` — data stores
  - `{Diamond}` — decision points
  - `((Circle))` — events, signals
- **Edges:**
  - `-->` solid arrow — direct dependency / call
  - `-.->` dashed arrow — optional / async
  - `==>` thick arrow — data flow emphasis
- **Subgraphs** — use to group related components
- **Keep diagrams readable** — max ~15 nodes per diagram. Split into multiple diagrams if needed.
